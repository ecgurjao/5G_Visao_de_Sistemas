<h1>Chapter 5:  Mobile Core<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-5-mobile-core" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>The Mobile Core provides IP connectivity to the RAN. It authenticates
UEs as they connect, tracks them as they move from one base station to
another, ensures that this connectivity fulfills the promised QoS
requirements, and meters usage for billing.</p>
<p>Historically, all of these functions were provided by one or more proprietary
network appliances. But like the rest of the 5G mobile network, these
appliances are being disaggregated and implemented as a set of cloud services,
with the goal of improving feature velocity for new classes of
applications. It is also the case that as the range of use cases grows
more diverse, a one-size-fits-all approach will become
problematic. The expectation is that it should be possible to
customize and specialize the Mobile Core on an per-application basis.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces the functional elements of the Mobile Core,
and describes different strategies for implementing that
functionality.</p>
<section id="identity-management">
<h2>5.1  Identity Management<a class="headerlink" href="#identity-management" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are two equally valid views of the Mobile Core. The
Internet-centric view is that each local instantiation of the Mobile
Core (e.g., serving a metro area) acts as a router that connects a
physical RAN (one of many possible access network technologies, not
unlike WiFi) to the global Internet. In this view, IP addresses serve
as the unique global identifier that makes it possible for any
RAN-connected device to communication with any Internet addressable
device or service. The 3GPP-centric view is that a distributed set of
Mobile Cores (interconnected by one or more backbone technologies, of
which the Internet is just one example) cooperate to turn a set of
physical RANs into one logically global RAN. In this perspective, the
IMSI burned into device SIM card serves as the global identifier that
makes it possible for any two mobile devices to communicate with each
other.</p>
<p>Both of these perspectives are correct, but since broadband
communication using Internet protocols to access cloud services is
the dominant use case, this section takes an Internet-centric
perspective of the Mobile Core. But before getting to that, we first
need to understand several things about the 3GPP-centric perspective.</p>
<p>For starters, we need to be aware of the distinction between
“identity” and “identifier”. The first term is commonly used when
talking about principals or users, and the second term is used when
talking about abstract objects or physical devices. Unfortunately, the
two terms are conflated in the 3GPP architecture: The acronym IMSI
explicitly includes the word “Identity”, where the “S” in both IMSI
and SIM stands for subscriber (a kind of principal), yet the IMSI is
also used as a global identifier for a UE connected to the mobile
network. This conflation breaks down when there could be tens or
hundreds of IoT devices for every customer, with no obvious association
among them. Accounting for this problem is an “architecture alignment”
fix we discuss in the next chapter when we describe how to provide
Private 5G Connectivity as a managed cloud service.</p>
<p>If we take the view that an IMSI is primarily a global identifier for
UEs, then we can think of it as the mobile network’s equivalent of a
48-bit 802.3 or 802.11 MAC address. This includes how addresses are
assigned to ensure uniqueness: (MCC, MNC) pairs are assigned by a
global authority to every MNO, each of which then decides how to
uniquely assign the rest of the IMSI identifier space to devices. This
approach is similar to how network vendors are assigned a unique
prefix for all the MAC addresses they configure into the NIC cards and
WiFi chips they ship, but with one big difference: It is the MNO,
rather than the vendor, that is responsible for assigning IMSIs to SIM
cards. This makes the IMSI allocation problem closer to how the
Internet assigns IP addresses to end hosts, but unlike DHCP, the
IMSI-to-device binding is static.</p>
<p>This is important because, unlike 802.11 addresses, IMSIs are also
intended to support global routing. (Here, we are using a liberal
notion of routing—to locate an object—and focusing on the original
3GPP-perspective of the global RAN in which the Internet is just a
possible packet network that interconnects Mobile Cores.) A
hierarchically distributed database maps IMSIs onto the collection of
information needed to forward data to the corresponding device. This
includes a combination of relatively <em>static</em> information about the
level of service the device expects to receive (including the
corresponding phone number and subscriber profile/account
information), and more <em>dynamic</em> information about the current
location of the device (including which Mobile Core, and which base
station served by that Core, currently connects the device to the
global RAN).</p>
<p>This mapping service has a name, or rather, several names that keep
changing from from generation to generation. In 2G and 3G it was
called HLR (Home Location Registry). In 4G the HLR maintains only
static information and a separate HSS (Home Subscriber Server)
maintains the more dynamic information. In 5G the HLR is renamed the
UDR (Unified Data Registry) and the HSS is renamed UDM (Unified Data
Management). We will see the UDM in Section 5.2 because of the role it
plays <em>within</em> a single instance of the Mobile Core.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many more details to the process—including how
to find a device that has roamed to another MNO’s network—but
conceptually the process is straightforward. (As a thought experiment,
imagine how you would build a “logically global WiFi” using just
802.11 addresses, rather than depending on the additional layer of
addressing provided by IP.) The important takeaway is that IMSIs are
used to locate the Mobile Core instance that is then responsible for
authenticating the device, tracking the device as it moves from base
station to base station within that Core’s geographic region, and
forwarding packets to/from the device.</p>
<p>Two additional observations about the relationship between IMSIs and IP
addresses are worth highlighting. First, the odds of someone trying to
“call” or “text” an IoT device, drone, camera, or robot are virtually
zero. It is the IP address assigned to each device (by the local
Mobile Core) that is used to locate (route packets to) the device. In
this context, the IMSI plays exactly the same role in a physical RAN
as an 802.11 address plays in a LAN, and the Mobile Core behaves just
like any access router.</p>
<p>Second, whether a device connects to a RAN or some other access
network, it is automatically assigned a new IP address any time it
moves from one coverage domain to another. Even for voice calls in the
RAN case, ongoing calls are dropped whenever a device moves between
instantiations of the Mobile Core (i.e., uninterrupted mobility is
supported only within the region served by a given Core). This is
typically not a problem when the RAN is being used to deliver
broadband connectivity because Internet devices are almost always
clients <em>requesting</em> a cloud service; they just start issuing requests
with their new (dynamically assigned) IP address.</p>

<h2>5.2 Functional Components<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-components" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The 5G Mobile Core, which 3GPP calls the <em>NG-Core</em>, adopts a
microservice-like architecture. We say “microservice-like” because
while the 3GPP specification spells out this level of disaggregation,
it is really just describing a set of functional blocks and not
prescribing an implementation. In practice, a set of functional blocks
is very different from the collection of engineering decisions that go
into designing a microservice-based system. That said, viewing the
collection of components shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-5g-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a> as
a set of microservices is a reasonable working model (for now).</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-5g-core"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide22.png"><img alt="_images/Slide22.png" src="_images/Slide22.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Figure 34. </span><span class="caption-text">5G Mobile Core (NG-Core), represented as a collection of
microservices, where 3GPP defines the interfaces connecting the
Mobile Core CP and UP to the RAN (denoted N2 and N3, respectively).</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Starting with the User Plane (UP), the <em>UPF (User Plane Function)</em>
forwards traffic between the RAN and the Internet. In addition to IP
packet forwarding, the UPF is responsible for policy enforcement,
lawful intercept, traffic usage measurement, and QoS policing. These
are all common functions in access routers, even if they go beyond
what you usually find in enterprise or backbone routers. The other
detail of note is that, because the RAN is an overlay network, the UPF
is responsible for tunneling (i.e., encapsulating and decapsulating)
packets as they are transmitted to and from base stations over the N3
interface (as depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="arch.html#fig-tunnels"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
10</span></a> of Section 2.3).</p>
<p>The rest of the functional elements in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-5g-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a> implement the Control Plane (CP). Of these, two
represent the majority of the functionality that’s unique to the
Mobile Core CP (as sketched in <a class="reference internal" href="arch.html#fig-secure"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 13</span></a> of
Section 2.4):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>AMF (Core Access and Mobility Management Function):</em> Responsible for
connection and reachability management, mobility management, access
authorization, and location services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>SMF (Session Management Function):</em> Manages each UE session,
including IP address allocation, selection of associated UP
function, control aspects of QoS, and control aspects of UP
routing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the AMF authorizes access when a UE first connects to
one of the local base stations, and then tracks (but does not control)
which base station currently serves each UE. The SMF then allocates an
IP address to each AMF-authorized UE, and directly interacts with the
UPF to maintain per-device session state.</p>
<p>Of particular note, the per-UE session state controlled by the SMF (and
implemented by the UPF) includes a packet buffer in which packets
destine to a UE currently in the middle of being handed off from one
base station to another are queued during the transition. This feature
was originally designed to avoid data loss during a voice call, but
its value is less obvious when the data is an IP packet since
end-to-end protocols like TCP are prepared to retransmit lost
packets. On the other hand, if hand-offs are too frequent, they can be
problematic for TCP.</p>
<p>Before continuing with our inventory of control-related elements in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-5g-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a>, it is important to note we show
only a fraction of the full set that 3GPP defines. The full set
includes a wide range of possible features, many of which are either
speculative (i.e., identify potential functionality) or overly
prescriptive (i.e., identify well-known cloud native microservices).
We limit our discussion to functional elements that provide value in
the private 5G deployments that we focus on. Of these, several provide
functionality similar to what one might find in any microservice-based
application:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>AUSF (Authentication Server Function):</em> Authenticates UEs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>UDM (Unified Data Management):</em> Manages user identity, including
the generation of authentication credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><em>UDR (Unified Data Repository):</em> Manages user static
subscriber-related information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>UDSF (Unstructured Data Storage Network Function):</em> Used to store
unstructured data, and so is similar to a <em>Key/Value Store</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>NEF (Network Exposure Function):</em> Exposes select capabilities to
third-party services, and so is similar to an <em>API Server</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>NRF (NF Repository Function):</em> Used to discover available services
(network functions), and so is similar to a <em>Discovery Service</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while the above list includes well-known microservices that
are similar to some of 3GPP-specified control functions, we do this
primarily to help explain the general role each component plays.  In
some cases, substituting an existing cloud native component is a
viable implementation option. For example, MongoDB can be used to
implement a UDSF. In other cases, however, such a one-for-one swap is
not possible due to assumptions 3GPP makes. For example, AUSF, UMD,
UMR, and AMF collectively implement a <em>Authentication and
Authorization Service</em>, but an option like OAuth2 could not be used in
their place because (a) UMD and UMR are assumed to be part of the
global identity mapping service discussed in Section 5.1, and (b) 3GPP
specifies the interface by which the various components request
service from each other (e.g., AMF connects to the RAN via the N2 interface
depicted in the figure). We will see how to cope with such
issues in Section 5.3, where we talk about implementation issues in
more detail.</p>
<p>Finally, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-5g-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a> shows two other functional
elements that export a northbound interface to the management plane
(not shown):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>PCF (Policy Control Function):</em> Manages the policy rules for the
rest of the Mobile Core CP.</p></li>
<li><p><em>NSSF (Network Slicing Selector Function):</em> Manages how network
slices are selected to serve a given UE.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that even though 3GPP does not directly prescribe a
microservice implementation, the overall design clearly points to a
cloud native solution as the desired end-state for the Mobile Core.
Of particular note, introducing a distinct storage service means that
all the other services can be stateless, and hence, more readily
scalable.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First, SD-Core supports both the 5G and 4G versions of the Mobile
Core,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a> which share a common User Plane (UPF). We have not
discussed details of the 4G Core, but observe that it
is less disaggregated.  In particular, the components in the 5G
Core are specified so that they can be stateless, simplifying the task
of horizontally scaling them out as load dictates. (The rough
correspondence between 4G and 5G is: MME-to-AMF, SPGW_C-to-SMF,
HSS-to-UDM, and PCRF-to-PCF.) Although not shown in the schematic,
there is also a scalable Key/Value Store microservice based on
MongoDB.  It is used to make Core-related state persistent for the
Control Planes; for example, UDM/UDR (5G) and HSS (4G) write
subscriber state to MongoDB.</p>
<dl class="footnote brackets">
<dt class="label" id="id2"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">1</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>SD-Core’s 4G Core is a fork of the OMEC project and its 5G Core

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sd-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 35</span></a> illustrates 3GPP’s
<em>Standalone (SA)</em> deployment option, in which 4G and 5G networks
co-exist and run independently. They share a UPF implementation, but
UPF instances are instantiated separately for each RAN/Core pair, with
support for both the 4G and 5G interfaces, denoted <em>S1-U</em> and <em>N3</em>,
respectively.  Although not obvious from the SA example, 3GPP defines
an alternative transition plan, called <em>NSA (Non-Standalone)</em>, in
which separate 4G and 5G RANs were paired with either a 4G Core or a
5G Core. The details of how that works are not relevant to this
discussion, except to make the point that production networks almost
never get to enjoy a “flag day” on which a new version is universally
substituted for an old version. A migration plan has to be part of the
design. More information on this topic can be found in a GSMA Report.</p>
<div class="admonition-further-reading admonition" id="reading-migration">

</div>
<p>Third, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sd-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 35</span></a> shows many of the
3GPP-defined inter-component interfaces. These include an over-the-air
interface between base stations and UEs (<em>NR Uu</em>), control interfaces
between the Core and both UEs and base stations (<em>N1</em> and <em>N2</em>,
respectively), a user plane interface between the Core and base
stations (<em>N3</em>), and a data plane interface between the Core and the
backbone network (<em>N6</em>).</p>
<p>The schematic also shows interfaces between the individual
microservices that make up the Core’s Control Plane; for example,
<em>Nudm</em> is the interface to the UDM microservice. These latter interfaces
are RESTful, meaning clients access each microservice by issuing GET,
PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations over HTTP, where a
service-specific schema defines the available resources that can be
accessed. (The 4G counterparts, such as <em>S1-U</em> and <em>S1-MME</em> are not
RESTful, but rather, conventional over-the-wire protocols.) Note that
some of these interfaces are necessary for interoperability (e.g.,
<em>N1</em> and <em>N Uu</em> make it possible to connect your phone to any MNO’s
network), but others could be seen as internal implementation
details. We’ll see how Magma takes advantage of this distinction in
the next section.</p>
</section>
<section id="magma">
<h3>5.3.2 Magma<a class="headerlink" href="#magma" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Magma is an open source Mobile Core implementation that takes a
different and slightly non-standard approach. Magma is similar to
SD-Core in that it is implemented as a set of microservices, but it
differs in that it is designed to be particularly suitable for remote
and rural environments with poor backhaul connectivity. This
emphasis, in turn, leads Magma to (1) adopt an SDN-inspired approach
to how it separates functionality into centralized and distributed
components, and (2) factor the distributed functionality into
microservices without strict adherence to all the standard 3GPP interface
specifications. This refactoring is also a consequence of Magma being
designed to unify 4G, 5G, and WiFi under a single architecture.</p>
<p>One of the first things to note about Magma is that it takes a
different view of “backhaul” from the approaches we have seen to
date. Whereas the backhaul networks shown previously connect the
eNBs/gNBs and radio towers back to the mobile core (<a class="reference internal" href="arch.html#fig-cellular"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 3</span></a>), Magma actually puts much of the mobile core

the core into centralized and distributed parts. So Magma views
“backhaul” as the link that connects a remote deployment to the rest
of the Internet (including the central components), contrasting with
conventional 3GPP usage. As explored further below, this can overcome
many of the challenges that unreliable backhaul links introduce in
conventional approaches.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-magma-arch"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 36</span></a> shows the overall Magma
architecture. The central part of Magma is the single box in the
figure marked <em>Central Control &amp; Management (Orchestrator)</em>. This is
roughly analogous to the central controller found in typical SDN
systems, and provides a northbound API by which an operator or other
software systems (such as a traditional OSS/BSS) can interact with the
Magma core. The orchestrator communicates over backhaul links with
Access Gateways (AGWs), which are the distributed components of
Magma. A single AGW typically handles a small number of eNBs/gNBs. As
an example, see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-magma-peru"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 37</span></a> which includes a
single eNB and AGW located on a radio tower. In this example, a
point-to-point wireless link is used for backhaul.</p>
<p>The AGW is designed to have a small footprint, so that small
deployments do not require a datacenter’s worth of equipment. Each AGW
also contains both data plane and control plane elements. This is a
little different from the classic approach to SDN systems in which
only the data plane is distributed. Magma can be described as a
hierarchical SDN approach, as the control plane itself is divided into
a centralized part (running in the Orchestrator) and a distributed
part (running in the AGW). <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-magma-arch"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 36</span></a> shows
the distributed control plane components and data plane in detail. We
postpone a general discussion of orchestration until Chapter 6.</p>

</figure>
<p>Magma differs from the standard 3GPP approach in that it terminates
3GPP protocols logically close to the edge, which in this context
corresponds to two interface points: (1) the radio interface
connecting Magma to an eNB or gNB (implemented by set of modules on
the left side of the AGW in the figure) or the federation interface
connecting Magma to another mobile network (implemented by the
<em>Federation Gateway</em> module in the figure). Everything “between” those
two external interfaces is free to deviate from the 3GPP specification,
which has broad impact as discussed below.</p>
<p>One consequence of this approach is that Magma can interoperate with
other implementations <em>only</em> at the edges. Thus, it is possible to
connect a Magma mobile core to any standards-compliant 4G or 5G base
station and expect it to work, and similarly, it is possible to
federate a Magma core with an existing MNO’s 4G or 5G network.
However, since Magma does not implement all the 3GPP interfaces that
are internal to a mobile packet core, it is not possible to
arbitrarily mix and match components within the core. Whereas (in
principle) a traditional 3GPP implementation would permit an AMF from
one vendor to interoperate with the SMF of another vendor, it is not
possible to connect parts of a mobile core from another vendor (or
another open source project) with parts of Magma, aside from via the
two interfaces just described.</p>
<p>Being free to deviate from the 3GPP spec means Magma can take a
unifying approach across multiple wireless technologies, including 4G,
5G and WiFi. There is a set of functions that the core must implement
for any radio technology (e.g., finding the appropriate policy for a
given subscriber by querying a database); Magma provides them in an
access-technology-independent way. These functions form the heart of
an Access Gateway (AGW), as illustrated on the right side of
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-magma-arch"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 36</span></a>. On the other hand, control
protocols that are specific to a given radio technology are terminated
in technology-specific modules close to the radio. For example, <em>SCTP</em>
shown on the left side of the figure is the RAN tunneling protocol
introduced in Section 2.3. These technology-specific modules then
communicate with the generic functions (e.g., subscriber management,
access control and management) on the right using gRPC messages that
are technology-agnostic.</p>
<p>Magma’s design is particularly well suited for environments where
backhaul links are unreliable, for example, when satellite is used.
This is because the 3GPP protocols that traditionally have to traverse
the backhaul from core to eNB/gNB are quite sensitive to loss and
latency. Loss or latency can cause connections to be dropped, which in
turn forces UEs to repeat the process of attaching to the core. In
practice, not all UEs handle this elegantly, sometimes ending up in a
“stuck” state.</p>
<p>Magma addresses the challenge of unreliable backhaul in several ways.
First, Magma frequently avoids sending messages over the backhaul
entirely by running more functionality in the AGW, which are located
close to the radio as seen above. Functions that would be centralized
in a conventional 3GPP implementation are distributed out to the access
gateways in Magma. Thus, for example, the operations required to
authenticate and attach a UE to the core can typically be completed
using information cached locally in the AGW, without any traffic
crossing the backhaul. Secondly, when Magma does need to pass
information over a backhaul link (e.g. to obtain configuration state
from the orchestrator), it does so using gRPC, which is designed to
operate reliably in the face of unreliable or low latency links.</p>
<p>Note that while Magma has distributed much of the control plane out to
the AGWs, it still supports centralized management via the Orchestrator.
For example, adding a new subscriber to the network is done centrally,
and the relevant AGW then obtains the necessary state to authenticate
that subscriber when their UE tries to attach to the network.</p>
<p>Finally, Magma adopts a <em>desired state</em> model for managing runtime and
configuration state. By this we mean that it communicates a state
change (e.g., the addition of a new session in the user plane) by
specifying the desired end state via an API call. This is in contrast
with the <em>incremental update</em> model that is common in the 3GPP
specification.  When the desired end state is communicated, the
loss of a message or failure of a component has less serious
consequences. This makes reasoning about changes across elements
of the system more robust in the case of partial failures, which are
common in challenged environments like the ones Magma is designed to
serve.</p>
<p>Consider an example where we are establishing user plane state for a set
of active sessions. Initially, there are two active sessions, X
and Y. Then a third UE becomes active and a session Z needs to be
established. In the incremental update model, the control plane would
instruct the user plane to “add session Z”. The desired state model,
by contrast, communicates the entire new state: “the set of sessions
is now X, Y, Z”. The incremental model is brittle in the face of
failures. If a message is lost, or a component is temporarily unable
to receive updates, the receiver falls out of sync with the sender. So
it is possible that the control plane believes that sessions X, Y and
Z have been established, while the user plane has state for only X
and Y. By sending the entire desired end state, Magma ensures that the
receiver comes back into sync with the sender once it is able to
receive messages again.</p>
<p>As described, this approach might appear inefficient because it
implies sending complete state information rather than incremental
updates. However, at the scale of an AGW, which handles on the order
of hundreds to a few thousands of subscribers, it is possible to encode the
state efficiently enough to overcome this drawback. With the benefit
of experience, mechanisms have been added to Magma to avoid overloading the
orchestrator, which has state related to all subscribers in the
network.</p>
<p>The desired state approach is hardly novel but differs from typical
3GPP systems.  It allows Magma to tolerate occasional communication
failures or component outages due to software restarts, hardware
failures, and so on. Limiting the scope of 3GPP protocols to the very
edge of the network is what enables Magma to rethink the state
synchronization model. The team that worked on Magma describes their
approach in more detail in an NSDI paper.</p>

<p>Finally, while we have focused on its Control Plane, Magma also
includes a User Plane component. The implementation is fairly simple,
and is based on Open vSwitch (OVS). Having a programmable user plane
is important, as it needs to support range of access technologies, and
at the same time, OVS meets the performance needs of AGWs. However,
this choice of user plane is not fundamental to Magma, and other
implementations have been considered. We take a closer look at the
User Plane in the next section.</p>

<h2>5.4 User Plane<a class="headerlink" href="#user-plane" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The User Plane of the Mobile Core—corresponding to the UPF component
in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-5g-core"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a>—connects the RAN to the
Internet. Much like the data plane for any router, the UPF forwards IP
packets, but because UEs often sleep to save power and may be in the
process of being handed off from one base station to another, it
sometimes has to buffer packets for an indeterminant amount of
time. Also like other routers, a straightforward way to understand the
UPF is to think of it as implementing a collection of Match/Action
rules, where the UPF first classifies each packet against a set of
matching rules, and then executes the associated action.</p>
<p>Using 3GPP terminology, packet classification is defined by a set of
<em>Packet Detection Rules (PDRs)</em>, where a given PDR might simply match
the device’s IP address, but may also take the domain name of the far
end-point into consideration. Each attached UE has at least two PDRs,
one for uplink traffic and one for downlink traffic, plus possibly
additional PDRs to support multiple traffic classes (e.g., for
different QoS levels, pricing plans, and so on.). The Control Plane
installs, changes, and removes PDRs as UEs attach, move, and detach.</p>
<p>Each PDR then identifies one or more actions to execute, which in 3GPP
terminology are also called “rules”, of which there are four types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Forwarding Action Rules (FARs):</strong> Instructs the UPF to forward
downlink packets to a particular base station and uplink traffic to
a next-hop router. Each FAR specifies a set of parameters needed to
forward the packet (e.g., how to tunnel downlink packets to the
appropriate base station), plus one of the following processing
flags: a <cite>forward</cite> flag indicates the packet should be forwarded up
to the Internet; a <cite>tunnel</cite> flag indicates the packet should be
tunneled down to a base station; a <cite>buffer</cite> flag indicates the
packet should be buffered until the UE becomes active; and a
<cite>notify</cite> flag indicates that the CP should be notified to awaken an
idle UE. FARs are installed and removed when a device attaches or
detaches, respectively, and the downlink FAR changes the processing
flag when the device moves, goes idle, or awakes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buffering Action Rules (BARs):</strong> Instructs the UPF to buffer
downlink traffic for idle UEs, while also sending a <cite>Downlink Data
Notification</cite> to the Control Plane. This notification, in turn,
causes the CP to instruct the base station to awake the UE. Once the
UE becomes active, the UPF releases the buffered traffic and resumes
normal forwarding. The buffering and notification functions are
activated by modifying a FAR to include <cite>buffer</cite> and <cite>notify</cite> flags,
as just described. An additional set of parameters are used to
configure the buffer, for example setting its maximum size (number
of bytes) and duration (amount of time).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage Reporting Rules (URRs):</strong> Instructs the UPF to periodically
send usage reports for each UE to the CP. These reports include
counts of the packets sent/received for uplink/downlink traffic for
each UE and traffic class.  These reports are used to both limit and
bill subscribers. The CP installs and removes URRs when the device
attaches and detaches, respectively, and each URR specifies whether
usage reports should be sent periodically or when a quota is
exceeded. A UE typically has two URRs (for uplink/downlink usage),
but if a subscriber’s plan includes special treatment for certain
types of traffic, an additional URR is created for each such traffic
class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality Enforcement Rules (QERs):</strong> Instructs the UPF to guarantee
a minimum amount of bandwidth and to enforce a bandwidth cap. These
parameters are specified on a per-UE / per-direction / per-class
basis.  The CP installs and removes QERs when a device attaches and
detaches, respectively, and modifies them according to
operator-defined events, such as when the network becomes more or
less congested, the UE exceeds a quota, or the network policy
changes (e.g., the user signs up for a new pricing plan).  The UPF
then performs traffic policing to enforce the bandwidth cap, along
with packet scheduling to ensure a minimum bandwidth in conjunction
with admission control in the control plane.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this section describes two complementary strategies for
implementing a UPF, one server-based and one switch-based.</p>
<section id="microservice-implementation">
<h3>5.4.1 Microservice Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#microservice-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>A seemingly straightforward approach to supporting the set of
Match/Action rules just described is to implement the UPF in software
on a commodity server. Like any software-based router, the process
would read a packet from an input port, classify the packet by
matching it against a table of installed PDRs, execute the associated
action(s), and then write the packet to an output port. Such a process
could then be packaged as a Docker container, with one or more
instances spun up on a Kubernetes cluster as workload dictates. This
is mostly consistent with a microservice-based approach, with one
important catch: the actions required to process each packet are
stateful.</p>
<p>What we mean by this is that the UPF has two pieces of state that
needs to be maintained on a per-UE / per-direction / per-class basis:
(1) a finite state machine that transitions between <cite>forward</cite>,
<cite>tunnel</cite>, <cite>buffer</cite>, and <cite>notify</cite>; and (2) a corresponding packet
buffer when in the <cite>buffer</cite> state. This means that as the UPF scales
up to handle more and more traffic—by adding a second, third, and
fourth instance—packets still need to be directed to the original
instance that knows the state for that particular flow. This breaks a
fundamental assumption of a truly horizontally scalable service, in
which traffic can be randomly directed to any instance in a way that
balances the load. It also forces you to do packet classification
before selecting which instance is the right one, which can
potentially become a performance bottleneck, although it is possible
to offload the classification stage to a SmartNIC.</p>
</section>
<section id="p4-implementation">
<h3>5.4.2 P4 Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#p4-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Since the UPF is fundamentally an IP packet forwarding engine, it can
also be implemented—at least in part—as a P4 program running on a
programmable switch. Robert MacDavid and colleagues describe how that
is done in SD-Core, which builds on the base packet forwarding
machinery described in our companion SDN book. For the purposes of
this section, the focus is on the four main challenges that are unique
to implementing the UPF in P4.</p>
<div class="admonition-further-reading admonition" id="reading-p4-upf">
<p class="admonition-title">Further Reading</p>
<p>R. MacDavid, <em>et al.</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/up4-sosr21.pdf">A P4-based 5G User Plane Function</a>.
Symposium on SDN Research, September 2021.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sdn.systemsapproach.org">Software-Defined Networks: A Systems Approach</a>.  November 2021.</p>
</div>
<p>First, P4-programmable forwarding pipelines include an explicit
“matching” mechanism built on <em>Ternary Content-Addressable Memory
(TCAM)</em>. This memory supports fast table lookups for patterns that
include wildcards, making it ideal for matching IP prefixes. In the
case of the UPF, however, the most common PDRs correspond to exact
matches of IP addresses (for downlink traffic to each UE) and GTP
tunnel identifiers (for uplink traffic from each UE). More complex
PDRs might include regular expressions for DNS names or require deep
packet inspection.</p>
<p>Because TCAM capacity is limited, and the number of unique PDRs that
need to be matched in both directions is potentially in the tens of
thousands, it’s necessary to use the TCAM judiciously. One
implementation strategy is to set up two parallel PDR tables: one
using the relatively plentiful switch SRAM for common-case uplink
rules that exactly matches on tunnel identifiers (which can be treated
as table indices); and one using TCAM for common-case downlink rules
that match on the IP destination address.</p>
<p>Second, when a packet arrives from the Internet destined for an idle
UE, the UPF buffers the packet and sends an alert to the 5G control
plane, asking that the UE be awaken. Today’s P4-capable switches do
not have large buffers or the ability to hold packets indefinitely,
but a buffering microservice running on a server can be used to
address this limitation. The microservice indefinitely holds any
packets that it receives, and later releases them back to the switch
when instructed to do so. The following elaborates on how this would
work.</p>
<p>When the Mobile Core detects that a UE has gone idle (or is in the
middle of a handover), it installs a FAR with the <cite>buffer</cite> flag set,
causing the on-switch P4 program to redirect packets to the buffering
microservice. Packets are redirected without modifying their IP
headers by placing them in a tunnel, using the same tunneling protocol
as is used to send data to base stations.  This allows the switch to
treat the buffering microservice just like another base station.</p>
<p>When the first packet of a flow arrives at the buffering microservice,
it sends an alert to the CP, which then (1) wakes up the UE, (2)
modifies the corresponding FAR by unsetting the <cite>buffer</cite> flag and
setting the <cite>tunnel</cite> flag, and once the UE is active, (3) instructs
the buffering microservice to release all packets back to the
switch. Packets arriving at the switch from the buffering microservice
skip the portion of the UPF module they encountered before buffering,
giving the illusion they are being buffered in the middle of the
switch. That is, their processing resumes at the tunneling stage,
where they are encapsulated and routed to the appropriate base
station.</p>
<p>Third, QERs cannot be fully implemented in the switch because P4 does
not include support for programming the packet scheduler. However,
today’s P4 hardware does include fixed-function schedulers with
configurable weights and priorities; these parameters are set using a
runtime interface unrelated to P4. A viable approach, similar to the
one MacDavid, Chen, and Rexford describe in their INFOCOM paper, is to
map each QoS class specified in a QER onto one of the available
queues, and assign a weight to that queue proportional to the fraction
of the available bandwidth the class is to receive. As long as each
class/queue is not over subscribed, individual UEs in the class will
receive approximately the bit rate they have been promised. As an
aside, since 3GPP under-specifies QoS guarantees (leaving the details
to the implementation), such an approach is 3GPP-compliant.</p>

</div>
<p>Finally, while the above description implies the Mobile Core’s CP
talks directly to the P4 program on the switch, the implementation is
not that straightforward. From the Core’s perspective, the SMF is
responsible for sending/receiving control information to/from the UPF,
but the P4 program implementing the UPF is controlled through an
interface (known as P4Runtime or P4RT) that is auto-generated from the
P4 program being controlled. MacDavid’s paper describes how this is
done in more detail (and presumes a deep understanding of the P4
toolchain), but it can be summarized as follows. It is necessary to
first write a “Model UPF” in P4, use that to program to generate the
UPF-specific P4RT interface, and then write translators that (1)
connect SMF to P4RT, and (2) connect P4RT to the underlying physical
switches and servers. A high-level schematic of this software stack is
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-p4-upf"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 38</span></a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Note that while this summary focuses on how the CP controls the UPF
(the downward part of the schematic shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-p4-upf"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 38</span></a>), the usage counters needed to generate URRs that flow
upward to the CP are easy to support because the counters implemented
in the switching hardware are identical to the counters in the Model
UPF. When the Mobile Core requests counter values from the Model UPF,
the backend translator polls the corresponding hardware switch
counters and relays the response.</p>
