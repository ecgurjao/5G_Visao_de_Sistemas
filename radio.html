<h1>Chapter 3:  Radio Transmission<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-3-radio-transmission" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>For anyone familiar with wireless access technologies that offer a
best-effort service, such as Wi-Fi, the cellular network presents a
notable contrast. This is mostly because cellular networks carefully
allocate available radio spectrum among many users (or more precisely,
UEs), aiming to deliver a certain quality to all active users in a
coverage area, all the while allowing those users to remain connected
while moving. They also aim to maximize the efficiency of spectrum
usage, as it is a finite and often costly resource. This has resulted
in a highly dynamic and adaptive approach, in which coding, modulation
and scheduling play a central role. 5G takes the cellular approach to
managing radio resources to a new level of sophistication.</p>
<p>Wireless transmission is full of challenges that don’t arise in wired
networks. Interference can arise from many sources ranging from
microwave ovens to baby monitors, while radio signals reflect off
objects such as buildings and vehicles. Some objects absorb wireless
signals. The properties of the wireless channel vary over time, and
depending on the frequency in use. Much of the design of cellular
radio systems is motivated by the need to deal with these challenges.</p>
<p>As we will see in this chapter, mobile cellular networks use a
reservation-based strategy, whereas Wi-Fi is contention-based. This
difference is rooted in each system’s fundamental assumption about
utilization: Wi-Fi assumes a lightly loaded network (and hence
optimistically transmits when the wireless link is idle and backs off
if contention is detected), while 5G assumes (and strives for) high
utilization (and hence explicitly assign different users to different
“shares” of the available radio spectrum).</p>
<p>The fact that 5G controls spectrum allocation carefully is central to
its ability to deliver guarantees of bandwidth and latency more
predictably than Wi-Fi. This in turn is why there is so much interest
in using 5G for mission-critical applications.</p>
<p>We start by giving a short primer on radio transmission as a way of
laying a foundation for understanding the rest of the 5G architecture.
The following is not a substitute for a theoretical treatment of the topic,
but is instead intended as a way of grounding the systems-oriented
description of 5G that follows in the reality of wireless communication.</p>
<section id="coding-and-modulation">
<h2>3.1 Coding and Modulation<a class="headerlink" href="#coding-and-modulation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The mobile channel over which digital data needs to be reliably
transmitted brings a number of impairments, including noise,
attenuation, distortion, fading, and interference. This challenge is
addressed by a combination of coding and modulation, as depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-modulation"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 17</span></a>.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-modulation"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide141.png"><img alt="_images/Slide141.png" src="_images/Slide141.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>

<p><span class="caption-number">Figure 17. </span><span class="caption-text">The role of coding and modulation in mobile communication.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At its core, coding inserts extra bits into the data to help recover
from all the environmental factors that interfere with signal
propagation. This typically implies some form of <em>Forward Error
Correction</em> (e.g., turbo codes, polar codes). Modulation then
generates signals that represent the encoded data stream, and it does
so in a way that matches the channel characteristics: It first uses a
digital modulation signal format that maximizes the number of reliably
transmitted bits every second based on the specifics of the observed
channel impairments; it next matches the transmission
bandwidth to channel bandwidth using pulse shaping; and finally, it
uses RF modulation to transmit the signal as an electromagnetic wave
over an assigned <em>carrier frequency.</em></p>
<p>For a deeper appreciation of the challenges of reliably transmitting
data by propagating radio signals through the air, consider the
scenario depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-multipath"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 18</span></a>, where
the signal bounces off various stationary and moving objects,
following multiple paths from the transmitter to the receiver, who may
also be moving.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-multipath"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide15.png"><img alt="_images/Slide15.png" src="_images/Slide15.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Figure 18. </span><span class="caption-text">Signals propagate along multiple paths from
transmitter to receiver.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a consequence of these multiple paths, the original signal arrives at
the receiver spread over time, as illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-coherence"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a>. Empirical evidence shows that the
Multipath Spread—the time between the first and last signals of one
transmission arriving at the receiver—is 1-10μs in urban
environments and 10-30μs in suburban environments. These multipath
signals can interfere with each other constructively or destructively,
and this will vary over time. Theoretical
bounds for the time duration for which the channel may be assumed to
be invariant, known as the <em>Coherence Time</em> and denoted
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_c\)</span>, is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[T_c =c/v \times 1/f\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the velocity of the signal, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> is the
velocity of the receiver (e.g., moving car or train), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is
the frequency of the carrier signal that is being modulated. This
says the coherence time is inversely proportional to the frequency of
the signal and the speed of movement, which makes intuitive sense: The
higher the frequency (narrower the wave) the shorter the coherence time,
and likewise, the faster the receiver is moving the shorter the coherence
time. Based on the target parameters to this model (selected according
to the target physical environment), it is possible to calculate
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_c\)</span>, which in turn bounds the rate at which symbols can be
transmitted without undue risk of interference. The dynamic nature of
the wireless channel is a central challenge to address in the cellular
network.</p>

</figure>
<p>To complicate matters further,
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-multipath"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 18</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-coherence"><span class="std std-numref">19</span></a> imply
the transmission originates from a single
antenna, but cell towers are equipped with an array of antennas, each
transmitting in a different (but overlapping) direction. This
technology, called <em>Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO)</em>, opens the
door to purposely transmitting data from multiple antennas in an effort
to reach the receiver, adding even more paths to the environment-imposed
multipath propagation.</p>
<p>One of the most important consequences of these factors is that the
transmitter must receive feedback from every receiver to judge how to
best utilize the wireless medium on their behalf. 3GPP specifies a
<em>Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)</em> for this purpose. In practice,
the receiver sends a CQI status report to the base station periodically
(e.g., every millisecond). These CQI messages report the observed
signal-to-noise ratio, which impacts the receiver’s ability to recover
the data bits. The base station then uses this information to adapt how
it allocates the available radio spectrum to the subscribers it is
serving, as well as which coding and modulation scheme to employ.
All of these decisions are made by the scheduler.</p>

<section id="scheduler">
<h2>3.2 Scheduler<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduler" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>How the scheduler does its job is one of the most important properties
of each generation of the cellular network, which in turn depends on
the multiplexing mechanism. For example, 2G used <em>Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA)</em> and 3G used <em>Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)</em>. How data is multiplexed is also a major differentiator for 4G
and 5G, completing the transition from the cellular network being
fundamentally circuit-switched to fundamentally packet-switched.</p>
<p>Both 4G and 5G are based on <em>Orthogonal Frequency-Division
Multiplexing (OFDM)</em>, an approach that multiplexes data over multiple
orthogonal subcarrier frequencies, each of which is modulated
independently. One attraction of OFDM is that, by splitting
the frequency band into subcarriers, it can send symbols on each
subcarrier at a relatively low rate. This makes it easier to correctly
decode symbols in the presence of multipath interference. The
efficiency of OFDM depends on the selection of
subcarrier frequencies so as to avoid interference, that is, how it
achieves orthogonality. That topic is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p>As long as you understand that OFDM uses a set of subcarriers, with
symbols (each of which contain a few bits of data) being sent at some
rate on each subcarrier, that you can appreciate that there are
discrete schedulable units of the radio spectrum. The fundamental unit
is the time to transmit one symbol on one subcarrier. With that
building block in mind, we are now in a position to examine how
multiplexing and scheduling work in 4G and 5G.</p>
<section id="multiplexing-in-4g">
<h3>3.2.1 Multiplexing in 4G<a class="headerlink" href="#multiplexing-in-4g" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We start with 4G because it provides a foundational understanding that
makes 5G easier to explain, where both 4G and 5G use an approach to
multiplexing called <em>Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access
(OFDMA)</em>. You can think of OFDMA as a specific application of OFDM,
that in the 4G case, multiplexes data over a set of 12 orthogonal
(non-interfering) subcarrier frequencies, each of which is modulated
independently.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a> The “Multiple Access” in OFDMA implies that data
can simultaneously be sent on behalf of multiple users, each on a
different subcarrier frequency and for a different duration of
time. The 4G-defined subbands are narrow (e.g., 15 kHz), and the
coding of user data into OFDMA symbols is designed to minimize the
risk of data loss due to interference.</p>
<dl class="footnote brackets">
<dt class="label" id="id2"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">1</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>4G uses OFDMA for downstream traffic, and a different
multiplexing strategy for upstream transmissions (from user
devices to base stations), but we do not describe it because
the approach is not applicable to 5G.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The use of OFDMA naturally leads to conceptualizing the radio spectrum
as a 2-D resource, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>,
with the subcarriers represented in the vertical dimension and the time to
transmit symbols on each subcarrier represented in the horizontal dimension.  The
basic unit of transmission, called a <em>Resource Element (RE)</em>,
corresponds to a 15-kHz band around one subcarrier frequency and the
time it takes to transmit one OFDMA symbol. The number of bits that
can be encoded in each symbol depends on the modulation scheme in use.
For example, using <em>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)</em>, 16-QAM
yields 4 bits per symbol and 64-QAM yields 6 bits per symbol. The
details of the modulation need not concern us here; the key point is
that there is a degree of freedom to choose the modulation scheme
based on the measured channel quality, sending more bits per symbol
(and thus more bits per second) when the quality is high.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id8">
<span id="fig-sched-grid"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Slide17.png"><img alt="_images/Slide17.png" src="_images/Slide17.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>

<p><span class="caption-number">Figure 20. </span><span class="caption-text">Spectrum abstractly represented by a 2-D grid of
schedulable Resource Elements.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A scheduler allocates some number of REs to each user that has data to
transmit during each 1 ms <em>Transmission Time Interval (TTI)</em>, where users
are depicted by different colored blocks in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>.
The only constraint on the scheduler is that it must make its allocation
decisions on blocks of 7x12=84 resource elements, called a <em>Physical
Resource Block (PRB)</em>. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a> shows two
back-to-back PRBs. Of course time continues to flow along one axis, and
depending on the size of the available frequency band (e.g., it might be
100 MHz wide), there may be many more subcarrier slots (and hence PRBs)
available along the other axis, so the scheduler is essentially
preparing and transmitting a sequence of PRBs.</p>
<p>Note that OFDMA is not a coding/modulation algorithm, but instead
provides a framework for selecting a specific coding and modulator for
each subcarrier frequency. QAM is one common example modulator. It is
the scheduler’s responsibility to select the modulation to use for each
PRB, based on the CQI feedback it has received. The scheduler also
selects the coding on a per-PRB basis, for example, by how it sets the
parameters to the turbo code algorithm.</p>
<p>The 1-ms TTI corresponds to the time frame in which the scheduler
receives feedback from users about the quality of the signal they are
experiencing. This is the CQI mentioned earlier, where once every
millisecond, each user sends a set of metrics, which the scheduler uses
to make its decision as to how to allocate PRBs during the subsequent
TTI.</p>
<p>Another input to the scheduling decision is the <em>QoS Class Identifier
(QCI)</em>, which indicates the quality-of-service each class of traffic is
to receive. In 4G, the QCI value assigned to each class (there are nine
such classes, in total) indicates whether the traffic has a <em>Guaranteed
Bit Rate (GBR)</em> or not <em>(non-GBR)</em>, plus the class’s relative priority
within those two categories.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a> focuses on
scheduling transmissions from a single antenna, but the MIMO technology
described above means the scheduler also has to determine which antenna
(or more generally, what subset of antennas) will most effectively reach
each receiver. But again, in the abstract, the scheduler is charged with
allocating a sequence of Resource Elements.</p>
<p>Note that the scheduler has many degrees of freedom: it has to decide which set of
users to service during a given time interval, how many resource
elements to allocate to each such user, how to select the coding and
modulation levels, and which antenna to transmit their data on. This is
an optimization problem that, fortunately, we are not trying to solve
here. Our goal is to describe an architecture that allows someone else
to design and plug in an effective scheduler. Keeping the cellular
architecture open to innovations like this is one of our goals, and as
we will see in the next section, becomes even more important in 5G where
the scheduler operates with even more degrees of freedom.</p>

<h3>3.2.2 Multiplexing in 5G<a class="headerlink" href="#multiplexing-in-5g" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The transition from 4G to 5G introduces additional flexibility in
how the radio spectrum is scheduled, making it possible to adapt the
cellular network to a more diverse set of devices and application
domains.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, 5G defines a family of waveforms—unlike LTE, which
specified only one waveform—each optimized for a different band in the
radio spectrum.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id3">2</a>  The bands with carrier frequencies below 1 GHz are
designed to deliver mobile broadband and massive IoT services with a
primary focus on range. Carrier frequencies between 1-6 GHz are
designed to offer wider bandwidths, focusing on mobile broadband and
mission-critical applications. Carrier frequencies above 24 GHz
(mmWaves) are designed to provide super-wide bandwidths over short,
line-of-sight coverage.</p>
<dl class="footnote brackets">
<dt class="label" id="id4"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id3">2</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>A waveform is the frequency, amplitude, and phase-shift
independent property (shape) of a signal. A sine wave is a simple
example of a
waveform.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These different waveforms affect the scheduling and subcarrier intervals
(i.e., the “size” of the resource elements described in the previous
section).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For sub-1 GHz bands, 5G allows maximum 50 MHz bandwidths. In this case,
there are two waveforms: one with subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz and
another of 30 kHz. (We used 15 kHz in the example shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>.)
The corresponding scheduling intervals are
0.5 and 0.25 ms, respectively. (We used 0.5 ms in the example shown
in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sched-grid"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>For 1-6 GHz bands, maximum bandwidths go up to 100 MHz.
Correspondingly, there are three waveforms with subcarrier spacings
of 15, 30 and 60 kHz, corresponding to scheduling intervals of
0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 ms, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>For millimeter bands, bandwidths may go up to 400 MHz. There are two
waveforms, with subcarrier spacings of 60 kHz and 120 kHz. Both have
scheduling intervals of 0.125 ms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These various configurations of subcarrier spacing and scheduling
intervals are sometimes called the <em>numerology</em> of the radio’s air
interface.</p>
<p>This range of numerology is important because it adds another degree
of freedom to the scheduler. In addition to allocating radio resources
to users, it has the ability to dynamically adjust the size of the
resource by changing the waveform being used. With this additional
freedom, fixed-sized REs are no longer the primary unit of resource
allocation.  We instead use more abstract terminology, and talk about
allocating <em>Resource Blocks</em> to subscribers, where the 5G scheduler
determines both the size and number of Resource Blocks allocated
during each time interval.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-scheduler"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 21</span></a> depicts the role of the scheduler
from this more abstract perspective. Just as with 4G, CQI
feedback from the receivers and the QCI quality-of-service class
selected by the subscriber are the two key pieces of input to the
scheduler. Note that the set of QCI values changes between 4G and 5G,
reflecting the increasing differentiation being supported. For 5G,
each class includes the following attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Resource Type: Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR), Delay-Critical GBR, Non-GBR</p></li>
<li><p>Priority Level</p></li>
<li><p>Packet Delay Budget</p></li>
<li><p>Packet Error Rate</p></li>
<li><p>Averaging Window</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum Data Burst</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while the preceding discussion could be interpreted to imply a
one-to-one relationship between subscribers and a QCI, it is more
accurate to say that each QCI is associated with a class of traffic
(often corresponding to some type of application), where a given
subscriber might be sending and receiving traffic that belongs to
multiple classes at any given time.</p>

<h2>3.3 Virtualized Scheduler (Slicing)<a class="headerlink" href="#virtualized-scheduler-slicing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The discussion up to this point presumes a single scheduler is
suitable for all workloads, but different applications have different
requirements for how their traffic gets scheduled. For example, some
applications care about latency and others care more about bandwidth.</p>
<p>While in principle one could define a sophisticated scheduler that
takes dozens of different factors into account, 5G has introduced a
mechanism that allows the underlying resources (in this case radio
spectrum) to be “sliced” between different uses.  The key to slicing
is to add a layer of indirection between the scheduler and the
physical resource blocks. Slicing, like much of 5G, has received a
degree of hype, but it boils down to virtualization at the level of
the radio scheduler.</p>
<p>As shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hypervisor"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 22</span></a>, the idea is to first
schedule offered traffic demands to virtual RBs, and then
perform a second mapping of Virtual RBs to Physical RBs. This sort of
virtualization is common in resource allocators throughout computing
systems because we want to separate how many resources are allocated
to each user (or virtual machine in the computing case) from the
decision as to which physical resources are actually assigned. This
virtual-to-physical mapping is performed by a layer typically known as
a <em>Hypervisor</em>, and the important thing to keep in mind is that it is
totally agnostic about which user’s segment is affected by each
translation.</p>

</figure>
<p>Having decoupled the Virtual RBs from Physical RBs, it is now possible
to define multiple Virtual RB sets (of varying sizes), each with its own
scheduler. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-multi-sched"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 23</span></a> gives an example with two
equal-sized RB sets, where the important consequence is that having made
the macro-decision that the Physical RBs are divided into two equal
partitions, the scheduler associated with each partition is free to
allocate Virtual RBs completely independent from each other. For
example, one scheduler might be designed to deal with high-bandwidth
video traffic and another scheduler might be optimized for low-latency
IoT traffic. Alternatively, a certain fraction of the available capacity
could be reserved for premium customers or other high-priority traffic
(e.g., public safety), with the rest shared among everyone else.</p>

<p>A final point to note is that there is considerable flexibility in the
allocation of resources to slices. While the example above shows
resources allocated in a fixed manner to each slice, it is possible to
make unused resources in one slice available to another slice, as long
as they can be reclaimed when needed. This is similar to how work-conserving
scheduling works in network queues: resources are not wasted if the
offered load in a class is less than the rate guaranteed for that class.</p>

<h2>3.4 New Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#new-use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We conclude by noting that up to this point we have described 5G as
introducing additional degrees of freedom into how data is scheduled
for transmission, but when taken as a whole, the end result is a
qualitatively more powerful radio. This new 5G air interface
specification, which is commonly referred to as <em>New Radio (NR)</em>,
enables new use cases that go well beyond simply delivering
increased bandwidth. 3GPP defined three such use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enhanced Mobile Broadband</p></li>
<li><p>Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications</p></li>
<li><p>Massive Machine-Type Communications</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These use cases reflect the requirements introduced in Chapter 1, and
can be attributed to four fundamental improvements in how 5G
multiplexes data onto the radio spectrum.</p>
<p>The first improvement is being able to change the waveform. This effectively
introduces the ability to dynamically change the size and number of
schedulable resource units, which opens the door to making fine-grained
scheduling decisions that are critical to predictable, low-latency
communication.</p>
<p>The second is related to the “Multiple Access” aspect of how distinct
traffic sources are multiplexed onto the available spectrum. In 4G,
multiplexing happens in both the frequency and time domains for
downstream traffic, but only in  the frequency
domain for upstream traffic. 5G NR multiplexes both upstream and
downstream traffic in both the time and frequency domains. Doing so
provides finer-grained scheduling control needed by latency-sensitive
applications.</p>
<p>The third advance is related to the new spectrum available to 5G NR, with the
mmWave allocations opening above 24 GHz being especially
important. This is not only because of the abundance of capacity—which
makes it possible to set aside dedicated capacity for
applications that require low-latency communication—but also because
the higher frequency enables even finer-grained resource blocks (e.g.,
scheduling intervals as short as 0.125 ms). Again, this improves
scheduling granularity to the benefit of applications that cannot
tolerate unpredictable latency.</p>
<p>The fourth is related to delivering mobile connectivity to a massive
number of IoT devices, ranging from devices that require mobility
support and modest data rates (e.g. wearables, asset trackers) to
devices that support intermittent transmission of a few bytes of data
(e.g., sensors, meters). None of these devices are particularly
latency-sensitive or bandwidth-hungry, but they often require long
battery lifetimes, and hence, reduced hardware complexity that draws
less power.</p>
<p>Support for IoT device connectivity revolves around allocating some of
the available radio spectrum to a light-weight (simplified) air
interface.  This approach started with Release 13 of LTE via two
complementary technologies: mMTC and NB-IoT (NarrowBand-IoT).  Both
technologies build on a significantly simplified version of LTE—i.e.,
limiting the numerology and flexibility needed to achieve high spectrum
utilization—so as to allow for simpler IoT hardware design. mMTC
delivers up to 1 Mbps over 1.4 MHz of bandwidth and NB-IoT delivers a
few tens of kbps over 200 kHz of bandwidth; hence the term
<em>NarrowBand</em>.  Both technologies have been designed to support over 1
million devices per square kilometer. With Release 16, both
technologies can be operated in-band with 5G, but still based on LTE
numerology. Starting with Release 17, a simpler version of 5G NR,
called <em>NR-Light</em>, will be introduced as the evolution of mMTC.
NR-Light is expected to scale the device density even further.</p>
<p>As a complement to these four improvements, 5G NR is designed to
support partitioning the available bandwidth, with different
partitions dynamically allocated to different classes of traffic
(e.g., high-bandwidth, low-latency, and low-complexity). This is the
essence of <em>slicing</em>, as discussed above.
Moreover, once traffic with different requirements can be served by
different slices, 5G NR’s approach to multiplexing is general enough
to support varied scheduling decisions for those slices, each tailored
for the target traffic. We return to the applications of slicing in
Chapter 6.</p>
